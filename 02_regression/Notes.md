## 1. What is this project about?

We build a model that **predicts the price of a car** from its characteristics (make, model, year, engine power, fuel type, transmission, etc.).

Imagine a website where a user lists a car for sale. The site can suggest a fair price automatically. That suggestion comes from our model.

This is a **supervised learning** problem:

- We have historical data where the answer (the price) is already known.
- The model learns the relationship between car characteristics and price.
- Later we use it on new cars where the price is unknown.

Because the thing we predict is a **number** (price in dollars), this is a **regression** problem.

## 2. Project plan

| Step | What we do |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Prepare the data and do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) |
| 2 | Use linear regression to predict price |
| 3 | Understand the internals of linear regression |
| 4 | Evaluate the model with RMSE |
| 5 | Feature engineering |
| 6 | Regularization |
| 7 | Use the model to make predictions |

Each step maps to the next lessons of chapter 2.

## 3. Key terms explained

**Regression**
A type of supervised learning where the target is a continuous number (price, temperature, salary). Compare with classification, where the target is a category (spam / not spam).

**Linear regression**
A model that predicts the target as a weighted sum of the features. In simple form:

```
price = w0 + w1 * year + w2 * horsepower + w3 * mileage + ...
```

The model learns the weights (`w0`, `w1`, ...) from the data.

**Features (X)**
The input columns used for prediction, such as year, engine HP, number of doors.

**Target (y)**
The value we want to predict. Here it is `MSRP` (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price).

**EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
Looking at the data before modelling: checking columns, missing values, distributions, outliers, and relationships. It tells us how to clean the data and what to expect.

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
A metric to measure how wrong the model is, in the same units as the target. Formula:

```
RMSE = sqrt( (1/n) * sum( (prediction_i - actual_i)^2 ) )
```

Lower is better. An RMSE of 3000 means predictions are typically off by roughly 3000 dollars.

**Feature engineering**
Creating new, more useful features from existing ones. Example: turn `year` into `age = 2017 - year`.

**Regularization**
A technique that stops the model weights from becoming too large. It reduces overfitting and keeps the model stable, especially when features are correlated.

**Overfitting**
When a model memorizes the training data (including noise) and performs badly on new data.

## 4. Setting up the environment

Install the libraries (run once in a terminal):

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

Start Jupyter:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Create a new notebook and start with the imports:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

%matplotlib inline
```

What each library does:

- `pandas`: tables (DataFrames), reading CSV files, cleaning data
- `numpy`: fast numerical arrays and math
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: plotting
- `%matplotlib inline`: show plots directly inside the notebook

---

## 5. Getting the dataset

Download the CSV file directly:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv
```

If `wget` is not available (for example on Windows), load it straight from the URL in Python:

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Or, if you downloaded the file next to your notebook:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```

---

## 6. First look at the data

```python
# Number of rows and columns
df.shape
```

```python
# First 5 rows
df.head()
```

```python
# Column names, data types, and non-null counts
df.info()
```

Expected columns in this dataset include:

- `Make`, `Model`, `Year`
- `Engine Fuel Type`, `Engine HP`, `Engine Cylinders`
- `Transmission Type`, `Driven_Wheels`, `Number of Doors`
- `Market Category`, `Vehicle Size`, `Vehicle Style`
- `highway MPG`, `city mpg`, `Popularity`
- `MSRP` (the target)

---

## 7. Key takeaways

- The goal is to predict car price (`MSRP`), which makes this a **regression** problem.
- The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition and has car characteristics as features.
- The plan: prepare data and EDA, linear regression, how it works internally, RMSE, feature engineering, regularization, and using the model.
- Tools used: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and later `scikit-learn`.
